Visiting About Firefox will automatically update your browser to the most recent version.

To configure Firefox to work with a proxy, visit:

    2. put the proxy id
    
It will be very exciting to see your proxy working through a real Web browser. Although the functionality of your proxy will be limited, you will notice that you are able to browse the vast majority of websites through your proxy.

An important caveat is that you must be very careful when testing caching using a Web browser. All modern Web browsers have caches of their own, which you should disable before attempting to test your proxyâ€™s cache.
